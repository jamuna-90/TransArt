TransArt-A-Multimodal-Application-for-Vernacular-Language-Translation-and-Image-Synthesis
âœ¨ TransArt: A multimodal application for vernacular language translation and image synthesis, leveraging Deep Learning and AI to transform Tamil text into creative visual content. Built with Gradio and Streamlit and Hugging Face technologies.

Overview
TransArt is a cutting-edge web-based application that seamlessly integrates language translation and creative AI to produce visual content from textual descriptions. The application translates text from Tamil to English and uses the translated text to generate relevant images, showcasing the potential of AI in enhancing communication and creative expression.

Problem Statement
The primary goal of TransArt is to develop a user-friendly platform that enables users to:

Translate Tamil text inputs to English using a neural machine translation model.
Generate images based on the translated English text using a text-to-image model.
Produce creative written content based on the same or separate translated text.
